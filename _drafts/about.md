I am a PhD candidate in Arabic linguistics at Lund Unviversity in Sweden. This blog is mainly mainly a way personal notebook, where I document some problem solving and ideas related to LaTeX, adocument preperation system, and vim, a nice editor. Much of this is stuff I learned and thought about while writing my d[dissertation](url). Occasionally I may write about Arabic linguisitics here as well.
