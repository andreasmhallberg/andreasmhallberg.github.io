Dilworth Parkinson's [arabiCorpus](http://arabicorpus.byu.edu/) is an online Arabic corpus, that is a large-scale collection of text. The corpus includes classical and modern texts of different genres, with emphasis on news prose. The site has a very user-friendly interface, making it good go-to tool simple linguistic questions.

In this post I use a number of typical questions that come up in everyday dealings with the Arabic language to illustrate different ways in which arabiCorpus can be used.

# Which is more common, *x* or *y*?

It is quite a common situation that there are two words or expressions with identical or similar meaning and your want to know which is the more common. One example is the two alternative forms of the feminine plural relative pronound, *allāti* and *allawāti*. Both of these in grammar books both these forms are listed but I have not seen and indication about which is the more common.

In 


# How it the word *x* used?

Sometimes you *mutājir*.

# Is the Classical Arabic word *x* still used in Modern Standard Arabic?
