Dilworth Parkinson's [arabiCorpus](http://arabicorpus.byu.edu/) is an online Arabic corpus, that is a large-scale collection of text. The corpus includes classical and modern texts of different genres, with emphasis on news prose. The site has a very user-friendly interface, making it good go-to tool simple linguistic questions.

In this post I use a number of typical questions that come up in everyday dealings with the Arabic language to illustrate different ways in which arabiCorpus can be used.

# How it the word *x* used?

Sometimes you

# Which is more common of the two synonyms *x* and *y*?

# Is the Classical Arabic word *x* still used in Modern Standard Arabic?
