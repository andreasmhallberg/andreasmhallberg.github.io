    A Contrastive Approach to the Analysis of Politeness Formulas 

    Root-echo responses in Syrian Arabic politeness formulas. CA Ferguson - Linguistic studies in memory of Richard Slade Harrell, 1967 [Finns i Göteborg]

    Root-Echo Responses in Egyptian Arabic Politeness Formulae. Devin Stweart. Understanding Arabic [UB ÖSF]

Arabic in its various dialects have highly developed systems of polite phrases for different situations, and most such phrases have a specific response. Knowing these phrases, in what situations they are used, and how to properly respond to them, is an important part of oral language proficiency in Arabic. I have not seen a comprehensive list of such phrases[^steward] and thought I'd set out to make one.

[^stewart]: For comprehensive lists of *im*polite responses to utterances in Egyptian, see Stewart, D.J., 1997. "Impoliteness formulae: the cognate curse in Egyptian Arabic." *Journal of Semitic Studies,* 42(2), ss.327–360..

The phrases below are given in Arabic and then in EALL transliteration as pronounced in Syrian Arabic. The translations provided are fairly literal. Many of the expressions no or only partial equivalent in English anyway. Each phrase is  followed by its appropriate response. Forward slash indicates alternative responses. Note that that Arabic text is the wrong way around relative to the reading direction, with the initial phrase to the left and the response to the right.

Includes only phrases for which there is a conventional response.

## Greetings

### General greetings

|                      |                                                         |
| :-                   | :-                                                      |
| السلام عليكم          | وعليكم سلام [ورحمة الله وبركاته]                         |
| *as-salāmu ʿalaykum* | *wa-ʿalaykum salām [wa-raḥmatu allāhi wa-barakātuh]*    |
| Peace be upon you.   | And upon you peace [and God's greace and his blessings] |

Islamic connotations. The pronoun *-kum* (3mpl) is invariable the phrase and in its response. The optional extension of the reply in brackets is recommended in a *ḥadiṯ*.

|            |                                        |
| :-         | :-                                     |
| مرحبا      | أهلاٌ/مرحبتين/مية مرحبا                  |
| *marḥaban* | *ahlan/marḥabatēn*/*mīt marḥaba*       |
| Hello      | Hi/Two *marḥaba*s/a hunderd *marḥaba*s |

### Greeting before noon

|                 |                                  |
| :-              | :-                               |
| صباح الخير      | صباح النور                       |
| *ṣabāḥ al-xēr*  | *ṣabāḥ an-nūr/ṣabāḥ al-full*     |
| Morning of good | Morning of light/Morning of rose |

*Xēr* does not easily lend itself to translation. Wehr, the standard Arabic-English lexicon, translates it as "good thing, blessing; wealth, property; --- good, benefit, interest, advantage; welfare; charity."

### Greeting after noon

Also general filler in pauses in polite conversation.

The pronoun is invariable. I was told about this phrase but have never actually heard it in use.

I have been told it is used by religiously conservative speakers but I have observed it myself.
