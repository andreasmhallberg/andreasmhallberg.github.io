    A Contrastive Approach to the Analysis of Politeness Formulas 

    Root-echo responses in Syrian Arabic politeness formulas. CA Ferguson - Linguistic studies in memory of Richard Slade Harrell, 1967 [Finns i Göteborg]

    Root-Echo Responses in Egyptian Arabic Politeness Formulae. Devin Stweart. Understanding Arabic [UB ÖSF]

Arabic has a highly developed system of formulaic polite phrases for different situations, and most phrases have a specific response. Knowing these phrases, in what situations they are used, and how to properly respond to them, is an important part of oral language proficiency in Arabic. I have not seen a comprehensive list of such phrases[^steward] and thought I'd set out to make one.

[^stewart]: For comprehensive lists of *im*polite responses to utterances in Egyptian, see Stewart, D.J., 1997. "Impoliteness formulae: the cognate curse in Egyptian Arabic." *Journal of Semitic Studies,* 42(2), ss.327–360..

The phrases below are given in EALL transliteration as pronounced in Syrian Arabic. The translations provided are very literal. Most of them have no equivalent in English anyway. Each phrases is followed by its appropriate response. Forward slash indicates alternative responses.

## Greetings

### General greeting

| | |
|:-|:-|
| *as-salāmu ʿalaykum* | *wa-ʿalaykum salām [wa-raḥmatu allāhi wa-barakātuh]*  |
| Peace be upon you. | And upon you peace [and God's greace and his blessings]. |

Religious connotations. The pronoun *-kum* (3mpl) is invariable the phrase and in its response. The optional extension of the reply in brackets is recommended in a *ḥadiṯ*.

| | |
|:-|:-|
| *marḥaban* | *ahlan/marḥabatēn*/*mīt marḥaba* |
| Hello | Hi/Two *marḥaba*s/a hunderd *marḥaba*s | 

| | |
|:-|:-|
| *salām* | *???* |
| Hello | | 

Very informal greeting between persons of equal social status.

### Greeting before noon

| | |
|:-|:-|
| *ṣabāḥ al-xēr* | *ṣabāḥ an-nūr/al-full*|
| Morning of good  | Morning of light/rose |

*Xēr* does not easily lend itself to translation. The standard Arabic-English lexicon (Wehr) gives "good thing, blessing; wealth, property; --- good, benefit, interest, advantage; welfare; charity."

### Greeting after noon

|:-|:-|
| *masāʾ al-xēr* | *masāʾ an-nūr*|
| Eavening of good | Evening of light |

### Welcoming

Also general filler in pauses in polite conversation.
 
### When being introduced to someone
