    A Contrastive Approach to the Analysis of Politeness Formulas

    Root-Echo Responses in Egyptian Arabic Politeness Formulae. Devin Stweart. Understanding Arabic [UB ÖSF]

Arabic has a highly developed system of formulaic polite phrases for different situations, and most phrases have a specific response. Knowing these phrases, in what situations they are used, and how to properly respond to them, is an important part of oral language proficiency in Arabic. I have not seen a comprehensive list of such phrases[^steward] and thought I'd set out to make one.

[^stewart]: For comprehensive lists of *im*polite responses to utterances in Egyptian, see Stewart, D.J., 1997. "Impoliteness formulae: the cognate curse in Egyptian Arabic." *Journal of Semitic Studies,* 42(2), ss.327–360..

The phrases below are given in EALL transliteration as pronounced in Syrian Arabic. The translations provided are very literal. Most of them have no equivalent in English anyway. Each phrases is followed by its appropriate response. Forward slash indicates alternative responses.

## Greetings

The pronoun *-kum* (3mpl) is invariable in this phrase and its response. The extension of the reply in brackets is recommended in a *ḥadiṯ*.
