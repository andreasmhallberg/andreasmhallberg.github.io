    A Contrastive Approach to the Analysis of Politeness Formulas 

    Root-echo responses in Syrian Arabic politeness formulas. CA Ferguson - Linguistic studies in memory of Richard Slade Harrell, 1967 [Finns i Göteborg]

    Root-Echo Responses in Egyptian Arabic Politeness Formulae. Devin Stweart. Understanding Arabic [UB ÖSF]

Arabic, in its various dialects, has highly developed systems of polite phrases for different situations, and many of these phrases have a specific response. Knowing these phrases, in what situations they are used, and how to properly respond to them, is an important part of Arabic communicative competence. For those of us who have learned Arabic as a second language, the number of these phrases, and indeed some of the situations that call for specific phrases, is remarkable, and they are tricky to learn, especially since they are typically not described in teaching materials. For native speakers, of course, this is simply part of language and it isn't given much thought. When, for example, someone says *naʿīman* to you after you have had a shower you just automatically reply *aḷḷa yinʿam ʿaleyk*.

Not knowing the basic phrases may lead to awkward social situations. One of the first people I got to know during my stay in Damascus always ended our telephone conversations by quickly asking me if I wanted something (*biddak ši?*). I found this a bit odd, as if I was a costumer in his shop, and in my confusion typically answered something like "no, thanks" (*lā, sukran*). There was always something awkward about these exchanges. It was only later that I discovered that this was just a formulaic phrase and that I was supposed to answer "your wellbeing" (*salāmtak*).  

[^steward]: For comprehensive lists of *im*polite responses to utterances in Egyptian, see Stewart, D.J., 1997. "Impoliteness formulae: the cognate curse in Egyptian Arabic." *Journal of Semitic Studies,* 42(2), ss.327–360.

The list below includes politeness formulae and their appropriate response as used in the Damascus area. I only include such phrases that I have heard in use, and it is thus bias to situations where a non-Arab male may find himself. The list is by no means complete, but I do believe it includes the most common phrases.

The phrases below are given in Arabic and then in EALL transliteration as pronounced in Syrian Arabic. The translations provided are fairly literal. Many of the expressions no or only partial equivalent in English anyway. Each phrase is  followed by its appropriate response. Forward slash indicates alternative responses. Note that that Arabic text is the wrong way around relative to the reading direction, with the initial phrase to the left and the response to the right.

Forward slash\ (/) indicates alternative responses. Parentheses indicate optional extensions to responses. Square brackets indicate clarifications in the  translation.

## Greetings

### General greetings

|                      |                                                         |
| :-                   | :-                                                      |
| السلام عليكم          | وعليكم سلام (ورحمة الله وبركاته)                         |
| *as-salāmu ʿalaykum* | *wa-ʿalaykum salām (wa-raḥmatu allāhi wa-barakātuh)*    |
| Peace be upon you    | And upon you peace (and God's greace and his blessings) |

Islamic greeting. The pronoun *-kum* (3mpl) is invariable the phrase and in its response. The optional extension of the reply in brackets is recommended in a *ḥadiṯ*.

|           |                                           |
| :-        | :-                                        |
| مرحبا     | أهلاً/مرحبتين/مية مرحباش/يا هلا              |
| *marḥaba* | *ahlan/marḥabatēn*/*mīt marḥaba*/hi       |
| Hello     | Hi/Two *marḥaba*s/a hunderd *marḥaba*s/hi |

### Greeting before noon

|                    |                                  |
| :-                 | :-                               |
| صباح الخير         | صباح النور                       |
| *ṣabāḥ al-xēr*     | *ṣabāḥ an-nūr/ṣabāḥ al-full*     |
| Morning of fortune | Morning of light/Morning of rose |

*Xēr* does not easily lend itself to translation. Wehr, the standard Arabic-English lexicon, translates it as "good thing, blessing; wealth, property; --- good, benefit, interest, advantage; welfare; charity."
