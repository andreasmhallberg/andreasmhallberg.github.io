## Introduction
Arabic, in its various dialects, has highly developed systems of polite phrases for different situations and many of these phrases have a specific response. Knowing these phrases, in what situations they are used, and how to properly respond to them, is an important part of communicative competence in Arabic.[^impoliteness] For those of us who have learned Arabic as a second language, the number of these phrases is remarkable. They are tricky to learn for a non-native speaker since there is often only one suitable response, and it has to be automatic and instantaneous. For native speakers, of course, this is simply part of language and it isn't given much thought. When, for example, someone says *naʿīman* to you after you have had a shower you just automatically reply *aḷḷa yinʿam ʿaleyk*.

[^impoliteness]: There are also fixed *impolite* responses to common phrases. For a fascinating and entertaining description of such responses in Egyptian Arabic, see Stewart (1997).

Not giving the proper response to a politeness phrase can often lead to awkward social situations and is often simply rude. As one scholar explains Stewart explains, these responses (Stewart 1996)

> signify an addressee's acceptance of the phrase to which they respond, thus serving as an indication that communications of concern, kindness, or other positive emotion has been successful, or that a social obligation has been properly fulfilled and is appreciated.

Thus not properly responding to one of these phrases, even if it because you as a non-native speaker does not know the answer, leads to a collapse of the mutual respect and politeness, and one of the parties either have to save the situation (by diverting attention from the event or call out what has just happened and explain the situation) or get offended. 

One of the first people I got to know during my stay in Damascus always ended our telephone conversations by quickly asking me if I wanted something (*biddak ši?*). I found this a bit odd, as if I was a costumer in his shop, and in my confusion typically answered something like "no, thanks" (*lā, sukran*). There was always something awkward about these exchanges. It was only later that I discovered that this was a formulaic phrase and that I was supposed to answer "your well-being" (*salāmtak*). When I tried this the first time I could proudly confirm that the conversation ended smoothly and that I had arisen to the occasion as a well functional social human being.    

The anecdote above illustrate one one of the probably hundred or so phrases and responses that are in common use. Keeping track of all of them can be a daunting task for the language learner. A trick I figured out was that the response *aḷḷa yixallīk* 'May God keep you safe' is an acceptable response in most situations, even if there is another response that is more common. (This response is also the one appropriate response to [one specific phrase](#haschildren) where it echoes the root of its main word.)

Many formulaic responses include a repetition of the root of the main word in the phrase that it is a response to, producing a wordplay. This means that often the same response work for several different phrases that all include words with the same root. For example, to all of the phrases [*yislam īdēk*](#thanks) 'thanks', [*sallim ʿala X*](#passagreeting) 'give my regard to&nbsp;X', and [*trūḥ u-tarjaʿ bi-salāma*](#departing) 'may you leave and return in peace', the appropriate response is *aḷḷa yisallimak* 'May God preserve you'. (See Ferguson 1997 for further discussion.)

## The list

The list below includes politeness formulae and their appropriate response as used in the Damascus area. I only include such phrases that I have heard in use, and it is thus a bias to situations where a non-Arab male may find himself. The list is by no means complete, but I do believe it includes the most common phrases. In some cases where I have been uncertain have I consulted native speaker informants.

The phrases below are given in Arabic script and then in EALL transliteration as pronounced in Syrian Arabic. The translations provided are fairly literal. Many of the expressions have no or only partial equivalent in English anyway, and the humorous effect of literal translations is sometimes hard to resist. Each phrase is followed by its appropriate response. Forward slash indicates alternative responses. Note that Arabic text is the wrong way around relative to the reading direction, with the initial phrase to the left and the response to the right.

Forward slash\ (/) indicates alternative responses. Parentheses indicate optional extensions to responses. Square brackets indicate clarifications in the  translation.


## Greetings

#### General greetings

|                      |                                                         |
| :-                   | :-                                                      |
| السلام عليكم          | وعليكم سلام (ورحمة الله وبركاته)                         |
| *as-salāmu ʿalaykum* | *wa-ʿalaykum salām (wa-raḥmatu allāhi wa-barakātuh)*    |
| Peace be upon you    | And upon you peace (and God's greace and his blessings) |

Islamic greeting signalling high degree of formality or allegiance to Islam. The pronoun *-kum* (3mpl) is invariable in the phrase and in its response. The optional extension of the reply in brackets is recommended in a *ḥadiṯ*.

|           |                                           |
| :-        | :-                                        |
| مرحبا     | أهلاً/مرحبتين/مية مرحبا/يا هلا              |
| *marḥaba* | *ahlan/marḥabatēn*/*mīt marḥaba*/hi       |
| Hello     | Hi/Two *marḥaba*s/a hunderd *marḥaba*s/hi |

#### Greeting before noon

|                    |                                  |

| صباح الخير         | صباح النور                       |
| *ṣabāḥ al-xēr*     | *ṣabāḥ an-nūr/ṣabāḥ al-full*     |
| Morning of fortune | Morning of light/Morning of rose |

*Xēr* does not easily lend itself to translation. Wehr, the standard Arabic-English lexicon, translates it as "good thing, blessing; wealth, property; --- good, benefit, interest, advantage; welfare; charity."
