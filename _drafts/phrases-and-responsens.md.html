<h1 class="title">Arabic politeness formulae and their responses</h1>
</div>
<p>Arabic has a highly developed system of formulaic polite phrases for different situations, and most phrases have a specific response. Knowing these phrases, in what situations they are used, and how to properly respond to them, is an important part of oral language proficiency in Arabic. I have not seen a comprehensive list of such phrases[^steward] and thought I'd set out to make one.</p>
<p>The phrases below are given in EALL transliteration and, since they often have no equivalent in English anyway, very literal translations. Each phrases is followed by its appropriate response. Forward slash indicates alternative responses.</p>
