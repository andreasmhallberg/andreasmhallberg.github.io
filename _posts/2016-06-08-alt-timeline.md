Sometimes, when reading about the classical Arabic grammarians, I find it difficult to visualize the actual time span between different authors. Years are of course always mentioned in the literature, but it is often still hard to get a feel for how big a chunk of time there is between a series of events. To get a better sense of the stages of development of Arabic grammar I have made a graphical *Timeline of Arab grammarians and their major works*. It is based on *The Arabic Linguistic Tradition* by Bohas et al. (2006), and lists all grammarians mentioned in their book, and uses their division into periods. A pdf with the timeline can be viewed/downloaded [here]({{ page.document }}).

The LaTeX source code can be found [here](/documents/alt-timeline.tex). I plan on also making an Arabic version of this timeline at some point.

Thanks to Georges Bohas for his comments, suggestions and corrections.
