The Arabic textbook *Alif Baa* (Georgetown University Press, 2014), the introductory book in the popular *Al-Kitaab* series lacks a good overview of the Arabic alphabet and how letters connect. (The table on pages 11--12 only shows the isolated forms.) I therefore device an overview of the alphabet of the type found in for example Schulz et&nbsp;al. (2000, a.k.a "the red book") in which all four forms of each letter are shown. This fits neatly on one page, so I populated the second with letters not traditionally part of the alphabet but that nevertheless need to be learned by students (أ إ ؤ ئ ء آ ة and ي), as well as the system of vowel markers. I also crammed in some (I hope useful) information in sidenotes. The intention is for students to have this document at hand as a reference sheet for the entirety their introductory course.
