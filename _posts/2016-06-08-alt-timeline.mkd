*Edit 2017-18-12: A version of this timeline in German has subsequently been published in* Einf√ºhrung in die arabische Grammatiktradition *by Frank Weigelt (Harrowitz, 2017).*

Sometimes when reading about the classical Arabic grammarians I find it difficult to visualize the actual timespan between different authors. Years are of course always mentioned in the literature but it is often still hard to get a feel for how big a chunk of time there is between a series of events.

To get a better sense of the stages of development of Arabic grammar I have made a graphical *Timeline of Arab grammarians and their major works*. It is based on *The Arabic Linguistic Tradition* by Bohas et al. (2006) and lists all grammarians mentioned in their book and uses their division into periods. A pdf with the timeline can be viewed/downloaded [here]({{ page.document }}).

The LaTeX source code can be found [here](https://github.com/andreasmhallberg/alt-timeline/blob/master/alt-timeline.tex). I plan on also making an Arabic version of this timeline at some point.

Thanks to Geroges Bohas for his comments, suggestions and corrections.
