<!-- Nr. of notes: git ls-files | grep "\.md$" | wc -l -->
I have spent some time the last couple of weeks formatting (and in some cases translating to English) notes I took during my PhD studies. I have done this formatting in order to a)&nbsp;make the notes more useful and searchable for me, and b)&nbsp;to make them potentially useful for others. In line with&nbsp;b), and also to have a convenient and accessible backup, I have put them in a repository on GitHub, a text/code hosting site. The notes can be found [here](https://github.com/andreasmhallberg/readingnotes). These notes are in some cases more or less complete summaries of articles, but in most cases they are only brief notes and extractions of quotes that I found interesting or useful for my projects. The [README](https://github.com/andreasmhallberg/readingnotes/#readme) in the repo gives a more thorough description of what the notes contain and how they are structured. Pleas read it if you are interesting in looking through the notes. I will keep adding to these notes as I read new articles and books, and edit and update older notes as I reread things.
