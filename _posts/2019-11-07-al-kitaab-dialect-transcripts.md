I am currently teaching a course in Syrian Arabic using material from the *Al-Kitaab* Arabic textbook. It is a complement to a course covering the Standard Arabic part of the same material. The dialectal material in this book is excellent. It is carefully designed to rely on vocabulary and grammar from the chapter at hand while still having an authentic feel to it and being slightly challenging. The material is however only available as videos (which have recently been made freely available on <http://alkitaabtextbook.com>). I have transcribed ~~some~~ most of it, namely the longer dialect dialogue found in each chapter. Having the transcripts available facilitates classroom discussion of the texts. The transcripts can be found [here](https://github.com/andreasmhallberg/al-kitaab-dialecttexts).

See the [readme](https://github.com/andreasmhallberg/al-kitaab-dialecttexts/blob/master/README.md) for more details and for a description of how I typically use them in classes.
