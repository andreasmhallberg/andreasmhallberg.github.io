*UPDATE: 2022. For an account of the theoretical/pedagogical underpinnings of these transcripts and of how they are used practically in the classroom, see my  article [A parallel text-based approach for teaching Standard and Vernacular Arabic](http://www.doi.org/10.33063/diva-484185) in Orientalia Suecana (2022).*

I am currently teaching a course in Syrian Arabic using material from the *Al-Kitaab* textbook, 3d edition, by Brustad, Al-Batal, Mahmoud, and al-Tunsi. The course runs parallel with a course covering the Standard Arabic part of the same material. The dialectal material in this book is excellent. It is carefully designed to rely on vocabulary and grammar from the chapter at hand while still having an authentic feel to it and being slightly challenging. The material is, however, only available as videos. In my view, having these dialogues as text facilitates classroom discussion of the dialogues. I have therefore transcribed most the Syrian Arabic material, namely the longer dialect dialogue found in each chapter. The transcripts can be found [here](https://github.com/andreasmhallberg/al-kitaab-dialecttexts).
