A am currently teaching a course in Syrian Arabic using material from the *Al-Kitaab* Arabic textbook. It is a complement to a course covering the Standard Arabic material. The dialectal material in this book is excellent. It is carefully designed to rely on vocabulary and grammar from the chapter at hand while still having an authentic feel to it and being slightly challenging. The material is however only available as videos (which have recently been made freely available on <http://alkitaabtextbook.com>). I have transcribed some of it, namely the longer dialectal dialogue found in each chapter. Having the transcripts available facilitates classroom discussion of the texts. The transcripts can be found [here](https://github.com/andreasmhallberg/al-kitaab-dialecttexts). More transcripts will be added in the near future as I need them for upcoming classes. See the [readme](https://github.com/andreasmhallberg/al-kitaab-dialecttexts/blob/master/README.md) for more details.
