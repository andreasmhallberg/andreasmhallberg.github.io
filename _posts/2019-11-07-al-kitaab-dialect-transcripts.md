A am currently teaching a course in spoken Syrian Arabic using material from the *Al-Kitaab* Arabic textbook. It is a complement to a course covering the Standard Arabic material. The dialectal material in this book is excellent. It is carefully designed to rely on vocabulary and grammar from the chapter at hand while still feeling authentic and being slightly challenging. The material is however only available as videos (which have recently been freely available on <http://alkitaabtextbook.com>). I have transcribed some of it, namely the longer dialectal dialogue found in every chapter, to facilitate classroom discussion of the texts. The transcripts can be found [here](https://github.com/andreasmhallberg/al-kitaab-dialecttexts). More transcripts will be added in the near future as I need them for upcoming classes. See the [readme](https://github.com/andreasmhallberg/al-kitaab-dialecttexts/blob/master/README.md) for more details and a description of how I typically use these transcriptions in class.
