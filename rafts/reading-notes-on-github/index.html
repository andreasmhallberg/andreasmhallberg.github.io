I have spent some time the last couple of weeks formatting (and in some cases translating to English) notes I took during and my PhD studies. This formatting I did in order to a) make them more useful and searchable for me, and b) to make them potentially useful for others. In line with point b), and also to have a convenient and accessible backup, I have put them as a repository on GitHub, a text/code hosting site. The notes can be found here. The notes are in some cases more or less complete summaries of articles, but in most cases they are only brief notes and extractions of quotes that I found interesting or useful for my project. The readme in the repo gives a more thorough description of what the notes contain and how they are structured. Pleas read it if you are interesting in looking through them. I will keep adding to these notes as I read more stuff and edit and update notes as I reread the sources.
