This document describes the infrastructure of for my personal homepage [Uppercase Alif](andreasmhallberg.github.io), the title of which only I find funny. It is built with the static website generator [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and forked from [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now).

# Post

Posts are placed in the `_posts` folder, are written in markdown. (The parser in GitHub Pages does not recognize `\ ` for nobreaking spaces so the HTML `&nbsp;` is used instead.).

## YAML headers

The YAML headers have the following attributes ():

- `layout`

    Should be `post`.

- `title` 

    Selfexplenatory.

- `permalink`

    Extension of http address to this post. If not explicitly made will be generated from date by Jekyll. Must be enclosed in `/`.

- `lang: en/sv`
