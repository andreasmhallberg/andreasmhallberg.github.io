I am a lecturer in Arabic at the University of Gothenburg. This blog is a space for me to write informally about Arabic linguistics, LaTeX, and related stuff that interests me, as well as to document various solutions, observations, and ideas.

Posts are written in English or Swedish depending on topic. Typos and poor grammar may occur. Typically, posts that get more views are more carefully edited post publication.
