This blog is a space for me to write informally about Arabic, (La-)TeX, and related stuff that interests me and to document various solutions, observations, and ideas. Posts are written in English or Swedish depending on topic.

I recently received my doctorate in Arabic linguistics from Lund University. My dissertation, *Case Endings in Spoken Standard Arabic* can be downloaded [here](https://lup.lub.lu.se/search/ws/files/3772169/8852155.pdf).
