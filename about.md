I have a PhD in Arabic linguistics from Lund University. This blog is a space I write about Arabic, LaTeX, and related stuff that interests me. It is a place for me to write informally about these matters and to document various, solutions, work flows, observations, and ideas. Posts are written in English, Swedish, or Arabic depending on topic.

My dissertation, *Case Endings in Spoken Standard Arabic* can be downloaded [here](https://lup.lub.lu.se/search/ws/files/3772169/8852155.pdf). If you are interested in the dissertations and want a free printed copy (I have a bunch of spare ones), please contact me at [andreas.hallberg@mellost.lu.se](mailto:andreas.hallberg@mellost.lu.se).
