This blog is a space I write about Arabic, (La-)TeX, and related stuff that interests me. It is a place for me to write informally about these matters and to document various, solutions, observations, and ideas. Posts are written in English or Swedish depending on topic.

I recently received my doctorate in Arabic linguistics from Lund University. My dissertation, *Case Endings in Spoken Standard Arabic* can be downloaded [here](https://lup.lub.lu.se/search/ws/files/3772169/8852155.pdf). If you are interested in the dissertations and want a free printed copy (I have a bunch of spare ones), please contact me at [andreas.hallberg@mellost.lu.se](mailto:andreas.hallberg@mellost.lu.se).
