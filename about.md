I am an Assistant Professor in Arabic at the University of Gothenburg. This blog is a space for me to write informally about Arabic linguistics, research and writing tools, and related things that interest me. Posts are written in English or Swedish depending on topic. Typos and poor grammar may occur. Typically, posts that get more views are more carefully edited post publication. 

My dissertation, *Case Endings in Spoken Standard Arabic* (Lund University, 2016), can be downloaded [here](https://lup.lub.lu.se/search/publication/530e5fe6-ec77-4e84-9a45-0935598e86a8).

This page is hosted on [GitHub](www.github.com) and is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) as a fork of [Jekyll Now](http://www.jekyllnow.com/).
